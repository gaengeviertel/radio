## approach

This project responds to the necessity of shaping the future and represents a space for the formulation of utopias and their experimental testing in the here and now. As a modern digital medium, radio is able to connect people and form autonomous communities. At the same time, it promotes the possibility of interdisciplinary collaboration and participation and is intended to transform people from passive listeners to active broadcasters.
All content is organized autonomously and decentralized. GÃ¤ngeviertel radio acts as an alternative network tool for discussion, exchange and development, and supports the principles of mutual aid and solidarity as well as resistance to all forms of discrimination and oppression. If you would like to contribute and you agree with the above principles, drop us a message on telegram.
Anarchism is not a unified position, but a constant discussion that can be continued through this communication medium. Start to live in the small as we want to live in the big. 

## background

Thanks to covid19 all social events were canceled. Searching for a way to connect humans and to share music, talks and thoughts, the idea of a decentralized radio came together and this is the final product. 

## structure

Within the [icecast](icecast) folder you can find the whole frontend code and the corresponding [icecast docker](icecast/Dockerfile) file. For displaying ical events as a program there is a small api located at [calendar-api](calendar-api). 

## usage

For instruction on how to use this have a look into the other folder.
